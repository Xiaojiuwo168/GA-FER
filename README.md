# GA-FER

Code implementation of paper "Neural architecture search using genetic algorithm for facial expression recognition" published on GECCO 2022.

## Requirements
- Pytorch

Torch 1.1.0 or higher and torchvision 0.11.2 or higher are required.

(Example: torch == 1.10.1,  torchvision  == 0.11.2,  numpy == 1.19.5)

## How to run

**Setp 1. Data Preparation**

  Download basic emotions dataset of [RAF-DB](http://www.whdeng.cn/RAF/model1.html#dataset), and make sure it have a structure like following:
 
```
- datasets/raf-basic/
         EmoLabel/
             list_patition_label.txt
	     new_10_noise.txt
	     new_20_noise.txt
         Image/aligned/
	     train_00001_aligned.jpg
             test_0001_aligned.jpg
             ...
```


**Step 2. Then you need to change the path where the dataset is loaded to your dataset path.
          The changes can be found on lines 47 and 48 of the cifar10.py file in the template folder.**

```
  trainloader = data_loader.get_train_loader('/home/dengshuchao/datasets/RafDb/raf-basic/',64,1,True,True)
  validloader = data_loader.get_valid_loader('/home/dengshuchao/datasets/RafDb/raf-basic/',64,1,False,True)
```

**Step 3. Set hyperparameters in *global.ini*.**

Ensure the following status before runningï¼š

[evolution_status]

is_running = 0

**Step 4. Run `python GA-FER-evolve.py`  or `nohup python -u GA-FER-evolve.py > GA-FER-evolve.log 2>&1 &`**
